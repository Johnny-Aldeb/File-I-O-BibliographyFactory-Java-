# File-I-O-BibliographyFactory-Java-
The BibliographyFactory is a tool that reads and processes .bib files, which contain information about one or more articles. The BibliographyFactory will determine if each input file is valid and, if it is, will create three output files in IEEE, ACM, and NJ formats based on the articles in the input file. The BibliographyFactory will be tested using 10 input files, called Latex1.bib to Latex10.bib. A .bib file considere invalid by the BibliographyFactory tool if The .bib file contains incomplete information (missing required fields).
The BibliographyFactory will output the results of its processing, including the number of valid and invalid input files and the number of articles in each output file, to the console. The BibliographyFactory will also handle errors and exceptions that may occur during its execution.
